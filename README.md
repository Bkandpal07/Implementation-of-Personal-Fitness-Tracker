The Personal Fitness Tracker is a web-based application built with Streamlit that helps users monitor their fitness progress. It predicts calories burned based on various health parameters, including age, BMI, exercise duration, heart rate, body temperature, and gender.

Using machine learning (Random Forest Regressor), the system analyzes user inputs to provide accurate calorie predictions. Additionally, it offers comparative insights, allowing users to see how their fitness metrics compare to others.

To ensure a personalized experience, the app features secure authentication with Streamlit Authenticator. This makes it a great tool for individuals who want to track their fitness progress efficiently and make data-driven health decisions.
